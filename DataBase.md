# scheduling App

## DataBase

* We must learn to query through different tables of information. We must be able to join tables and be able to use other sql features. The program we are making must be able to access the Allen ISD schedule database to be able to deterimne the availability of classes and other requirements that may be necessary like the location of the class, if IB or AP, also if an application is required to take the class.
* the program we are making will be going through the scheduling database and be able to request a specific table and return the proper table. 
* we will be using either sql or mysql to parse through the database
* the project will be able to provide a way for students to look at different possible schedules they could have for the following school year.

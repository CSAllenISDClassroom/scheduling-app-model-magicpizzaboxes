## Show Schedule Conflicts
### Functionality
this is the functionality
### Design
this is the development
### QA
Our testing procedure is to identify scheduling conflict through error
messages or warnings when it occurs by intentionally scheduling
conflicting classes. The test succeeds when conflicts are
identified/displayed to the user and fails if left unnoticed.

## Calculate Maximum GPA
### Functionality
### Design
In order to calculate the maximum GPA for classes, we will have to add
the maximum GPA in each of the student’s classes then divide it by the
number of classes that the students took.
### QA
Manually calculate the GPA through a calculator and make sure that the
number displayed within the app matches the result of the GPA
calculator. The test succeeds when the number matches the result of
the GPA calculator and has an error message if users have an
inappropriate input, and fails if something else appears.


## Show Credits Gained Based on Schedule
### Functionality
Upon reviewing one's schedule, the Sample Scheduling App will
calculate how many credits the schedule will provide. Our database
will include data about what type of credit each class gives. Based on
the user's current grade level, our app will let the user know if they
are on track to graduate with Allen ISD's required credits.
### Design
In order to calculate the credits gained based on schedule, we will
have to add up all of the credits that the student has in their
schedule.
### QA
Add classes to the schedule and see if credit is added. If credit does
not increase, then the test does not pass. If credit is gained for
every instance of adding a class, then the test is passed.

## Comprehensive Class Search Feature with Filtering
### Functionality
There are a lot of classes offered at Allen ISD. The ability to search
and filter classes based on keywords will help the student navigate
through the class choices. The app will feature a search bar for
finding classes to add to one's sample schedule. The search bar will
include a filter option to filter classes by category (ex: Math,
Science, English), available class periods, and level (ex: College
Prep, Pre-AP, AP, IB).
### Design
In order to filter the classes through classes we will have to have a
list off all of the categories that each class is in. We can then
filter through the classes based on their included categories and
their names.
### QA
Our testing procedure to ensure that all classes in the given subject
are included when searched with the key word of the subject. Require
that classes not found in the subject aren't misplaced (example:
English literature and composition found under key word “Math”.

## Ability to Print and Share Schedules
### Functionality
### Design
We will need to be able to write schedules to a local save and then be
able to send it to other applications. We will need to research how to
connect from this app to others.
### QA
Attempt to export the schedule. Export needs to be in proper format
(ie pdf or whatever is needed). If the exported file is properly
formatted then passed, else fail.

## AB Day View
### Functionality
### Design
Like the Search Feature with filtering, we will have to filter all
available classes based on the day. In order to do this, we can find
whether a class lies on A or B day. After we have this information, it
will be easy to filter the classes that are in view to a specified A/B
day.
### QA
Our testing procedure is making sure the period is put in the correct
A/B day. The test succeeds if periods 1,2,3,4,8 are on A day and
periods 1,5,6,7,8 are on B day and appear the correct schedule on the
correct A/B school day. If anything else appears, it fails.

## Links for Help
including filing help tickets from the app
### Functionality
### Design
### QA
First, the links for help open up when clicked. Then make sure the
proper website is opened up and ensure that the correct content is
opened up on the websites.

## School Map
maybe it shows where your classes are and the path youll take from
class to class
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Ability to Add Notes
we will need to have the ability for users to sign in and store their
notes for this
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Ability to Sign In
can track who uses app and give engagement points
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## See Class Difficulties
maybe the AP exam the class takes as well
### Functionality
### Design
Survey a large group of students, including those who have taken the
class in question in order to make a class difficulty rank. This is
another instance of an inforation based display. After we have the
information about different aspects of the class (AP Exam Pass Rate,
Average Grade, Information from the Survey, Etc.), we can display it
easily by the class making it accessible to the student.
### QA

## Assign Classes an Arena Scheduling Priority Score
based on class demand
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Show Details for Each Class
location, lunch, credits, pre-requistates, etc. Maybe take data from
Academic Planning Guide.
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Enforce Credit and Endorsement Requirements
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Show Live Class Stats
like # of people who selected it, etc.
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Combined School Class List
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Viewable Blocked Schedule
### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## More App Accessibility
Im thinking like an app or easier access website link. If we make an
app, this is definitly a reach.
### Functionality
### Design
### QA
Make sure the link for download takes users to the correct download
page. Ensures that the app can be found on Apple and Google Play
store. Using a phone, test to see if the app downloads properly and
all functions on the phone are properly working.

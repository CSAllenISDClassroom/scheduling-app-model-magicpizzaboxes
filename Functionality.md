## Show Schedule Conflicts
### Functionality
this is the functionality
### Design
this is the development
### QA
this is the quality assurance

## Calculate Maximum GPA
### Functionality
### Design
In order to calculate the maximum GPA for classes, we will have to add the maximum GPA in each of the studentâ€™s classes then divide it by the number of classes that the students took.
### QA

## Show Credits Gained Based on Schedule
### Functionality
Upon reviewing one's schedule, the Sample Scheduling App will calculate how many credits the schedule will provide. Our database will include data about what type of credit each class gives. Based on the user's current grade level, our app will let the user know if they are on track to graduate with Allen ISD's required credits.
### Design
In order to calculate the credits gained based on schedule, we will have to add up all of the credits that the student has in their schedule.
### QA

## Comprehensive Class Search Feature with Filtering
### Functionality
There are a lot of classes offered at Allen ISD. The ability to search and filter classes based on keywords will help the student navigate through the class choices. The app will feature a search bar for finding classes to add to one's sample schedule. The search bar will include a filter option to filter classes by category (ex: Math, Science, English), available class periods, and level (ex: College Prep, Pre-AP, AP, IB).
### Design
In order to filter the classes through classes we will have to have a list off all of the categories that each class is in. We can then filter through the classes based on their included categories and their names.
### QA

## Ability to Print and Share Schedules
### Functionality
Upon completing the organizer to create a valid schedule, the user will be able to access a printing screen. In addition, users will be able to share a link, that gives the querier access to print/veiw the completed schedule.
### Design
We will need to be able to write schedules to a local save and then be able to send it to other applications. We will need to research how to connect from this app to others.
### QA

## AB Day View
### Functionality
### Design
Like the Search Feature with filtering, we will have to filter all available classes based on the day. In order to do this, we can find whether a class lies on A or B day. After we have this information, it will be easy to filter the classes that are in view to a specified A/B day. 
### QA

## Links for Help
including filing help tickets from the app
### Functionality
The website will have a built-in, dedicated page as a help center. This help center will contain Frequently asked questions, links to resouces, and a way to communicte directly with counslers at Allen High School.
### Design
### QA

## School Map

## Ability to Add Notes

### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## Ability to Sign In

### Functionality
### Design
### QA

## See Class Difficulties
maybe the AP exam the class takes as well
### Functionality
### Design
Survey a large group of students, including those who have taken the class in question in order to make a class difficulty rank. This is another instance of an inforation based display. After we have the information about different aspects of the class (AP Exam Pass Rate, Average Grade, Information from the Survey, Etc.), we can display it easily by the class making it accessible to the student.
### QA

## Assign Classes an Arena Scheduling Priority Score
based on class demand
### Functionality
Users will be able to take a survey after loggining into their account. This survey will tabulate the ammount of requests for a class, and it's respective periods in order to know the amount of demand, and therefor competition to schedule that class. This will allow users to know which classes to prioritze in the correct order.
### Design
### QA

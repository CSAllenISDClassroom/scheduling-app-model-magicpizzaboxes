## Calculate Maximum GPA
### Functionality
### Design
In order to calculate the maximum GPA for classes, we will have to add the maximum GPA in each of the studentâ€™s classes then divide it by the number of classes that the students took.
### QA

## Show Credits Gained Based on Schedule
### Functionality
Upon reviewing one's schedule, the Sample Scheduling App will calculate how many credits the schedule will provide. Our database will include data about what type of credit each class gives. Based on the user's current grade level, our app will let the user know if they are on track to graduate with Allen ISD's required credits.
### Design
In order to calculate the credits gained based on schedule, we will have to add up all of the credits that the student has in their schedule.

## Comprehensive Class Search Feature with Filtering
### Functionality
There are a lot of classes offered at Allen ISD. The ability to search and filter classes based on keywords will help the student navigate through the class choices. The app will feature a search bar for finding classes to add to one's sample schedule. The search bar will include a filter option to filter classes by category (ex: Math, Science, English), available class periods, and level (ex: College Prep, Pre-AP, AP, IB).
### Design
In order to filter the classes through classes we will have to have a list off all of the categories that each class is in. We can then filter through the classes based on their included categories and their names.

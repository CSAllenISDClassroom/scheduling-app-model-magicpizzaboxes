### Role Responsibilities
* **Project Manager**: The project manager is responsible for creating a timeline and assuring that the managers work with the engineers to complete the project on time. They also ensure that the project as a whole is on or ahead of schedule to ensure completion by the deadline.
* **Product Manager**: The product manager is responsible for choosing the features of the website and approving ideas. The project manager analyzes the risk of a feature and hands it off to the development manager and engineers.
* **Development Manager**: The development manager assigns the implementation of features to the development engineers. They ensure that the engineers keep up with deadlines and implement features successfully.
* **QA Manager**: The QA manager ensures quality assurance: for the project to have no bugs and for all the features to function properly and a smooth experience for users. The quality assurance  manager produces a list of tests for every feature that needs to be passed before every release.
* **Release Manager**: The release manager works with the repository, managing the forks, issues, and all other aspects. The release manager ensures that the quality of the repository is retained, working alongside the QA manager.
* **QA Engineer**: QA engineers are responsible for working with forks to ensure that no issues have been created or re-introduced. They ensure the new forked code is efficient, follows common practices, and can be easily understood by any other person with the help of comments and meaningful names.
* **Development Engineer**: Development engineers are responsible for working on the functionality of the project and implementing desired features. They create adaptable code which could easily be modified if needed and split up tasks with their fellow development engineers.

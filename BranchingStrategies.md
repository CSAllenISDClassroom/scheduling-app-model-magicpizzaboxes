## Trunk-based Development

Trunk-based development (TBD) is a branching strategy where all
developers integrate their changes directly to a shared trunk every
day, a shared trunk that is always in a releasable state. No matter
what a developer might do on their local repository, at least once
each day, they must integrate their code. This practice forces each
developer to regularly see and react to the changes being made by
their teammates in version control, which drives collaboration around
the quality and state of the codebase as a near-constant activity.


### Pros:
	
*  Integrating changes every day makes you have to take small steps in
   your work. This limits the blast radius of any changes that cause a
   problem in production.
* TBD puts continuous integration front and center in a developerâ€™s
  workflow. You simply must integrate your changes every day;
  realizing that instantly makes you think differently about how you
  approach your work and your collaboration with your team
  members. And continuously integrating code changes is essential to
  innovating at a faster pace.

	  
### Cons:
	  
* One of the main challenges with trunk-based development is
  contention collision. If too many people are checking and making
  changes into the mainline at the same time,developers can end up
  tripping over each other and constantly breaking the codes.

* No one has total control over what is being modified in your code
  base. It is impossible to separate good code from bad code. To
  implement this model. Because of this reason, you will want to have
  only experienced developers on your team or the code may be ruin and
  mixed with bad codes
